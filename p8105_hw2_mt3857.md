\#Data Cleaning Process:

1.  **Data Import**:

    - The datasets `bakers.csv`, `bakes.csv`, and `results.csv` were
      imported using the `read_csv()` function. Each dataset contains
      key information about the bakers, their bakes, and the results of
      each episode.

2.  **Handling Data Types**:

    - In the `results.csv` file, the columns `series` and `episode` were
      initially in character format. Since these columns should
      represent numeric values (series numbers and episode numbers),
      they were converted to numeric using the `mutate()` function. This
      was necessary to ensure smooth merging with other datasets, which
      had their `Series` and `Episode` columns in numeric format as
      well.

3.  **Merging the Datasets**:

    - The three datasets were merged using `left_join()` on the common
      columns `Baker`, `Series`, and `Episode`. This allowed us to
      combine all the information about the bakers, their bakes, and the
      episode results into a single dataset, where each row represents a
      baker’s performance in a specific episode.

4.  **Filtering and Selecting Relevant Columns**:

    - After the merge, unnecessary columns were removed, and only the
      relevant columns (such as `Baker`, `Signature Bake`,
      `Show Stopper`, `technical rank`, and `result`) were kept for
      further analysis. This resulted in a clean dataset focused on the
      core aspects of the show.

5.  **Exporting the Clean Dataset**:

    - The cleaned dataset was saved to a CSV file for easy access and
      further analysis.

    The final dataset is well-organized and contains the following
    information for each episode-baker combination:

    - **Baker Name**.

    - **Signature Bake** and **Show Stopper** bakes.

    - **Technical Challenge Rank**.

    - **Episode Result** (such as whether the baker stayed, was
      eliminated, or won Star Baker).

    This dataset is tidy, with each row representing an individual
    observation (a baker’s performance in a given episode), and each
    column representing a specific variable (bakes, technical challenge
    results, etc.). This structure makes it easy to analyze bakers’
    performances across episodes and seasons.
